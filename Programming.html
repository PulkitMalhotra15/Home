												<h3>CERN ROOT</h3>
											</header>
											<p> ROOT is a modular scientific software toolkit, CERN's primary tool for data analysisexperiment that they want to perform. <br>
											It provides all the functionalities needed to deal with big data processing, statistical analysis, visualization and storage. It is mainly written in C++ but integrated with other languages such as Python and R. <br>
											<br>	
											As part of my research project at CERN, I learnt ROOT.<br>
											<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
											<li> Coded several routines to track and recreate particle beam path using position data from the detectors.</li>
 											<li>Analyzed the data to further to study particle behavior.</li>
 											<li>Further analysed the data, to come with a trend of the particles under varying electromagnetic settings </li>

												<h3>SPYDER</h3>
												<h4>Scientific Python Development Environment</h4>
											</header>
											<p>  Spyder is an open source cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) for scientific programming in the Python language.<br>

											Spyder integrates with a number of prominent packages in the scientific Python stack, including NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, pandas, IPython, SymPy and Cython, as well as other open source software.<br>

											<br>

											As part of my research project at University of Mumbai, I learnt Spyder.<br>

											<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
											<li>It was used to analyse lunar dust under various spectrums.</li>
											<li>We used further processed all the images to be fit for analysis, via cropping, rotating and centering of the moon</li>
											<li>Created a routines to further plot data under the various spectrums and save them in a data matrix</li>
 											<li> We thus created a model to predict and explain the behaviour</li>
 											<li> I particularly used Aperture Photometry (photutils.aperture) to analyse Lunar dust data in my research internship at University of Mumbai </li>

												<h3>Python</h3>
											</header>
											<p>  Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.<br> 
											<br>

											As part of my research project at University of Mumbai and CERN, I learnt Python.<br>

											<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
											<li>I have a good knowledge of Python and have been doing it for the past 3 years. </li>
											<li>It was used to analyse various data sets.</li>
											<li>Can build and execute modules to analyse and study different types of data sets,</li>
											<li>Have a good understanding the concept of functions and recursion and know how to create and use Python libraries.</li>

												<h3>C++/C</h3>
											</header>
											<p>  C++ is a general-purpose programming language.It  was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.<br>

											<br>I have a good knowledge of C++ and have been doing it for the past 4 years.
											 <br>

											<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
											<li>Have a good understanding  of file handling and efficiency in algorithms and computing in general. </li>
											<li>Learnt basic data structures: lists, stacks, and queues and computer networks: network stack, basic network hardware, basic protocols, and basic tools.</li>
											<li>Can build and execute modules to analyse and study different types of data sets</li>
 											<li>Did a school project titled "On Time-Complexity of various Sorting algorithms" in which I used C++ to measure the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm.</li>
 											<li> Various sorting algorithms using different data sets. The result was further filtered using Big-O notation and ranked accordingly.</li>
